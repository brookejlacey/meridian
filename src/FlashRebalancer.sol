/// @dev Flow: flash borrow → withdraw from source tranche → invest in target tranche → repay.
///      This lets a Senior holder rotate to Equity (or vice versa) in a single atomic tx.
///      No separate approval needed — the user only needs to approve this contract for
///      their tranche tokens (for the burn during withdraw).
///
///      Example: Alice has 100k in Senior (5% APR), wants to move to Equity (15% APR).
///      1. Flash borrow 100k underlying
///      2. Invest 100k in Equity tranche (user gets equity tokens)
///      3. Withdraw 100k from Senior tranche (burns senior tokens, gets underlying back)
///      4. Repay flash loan
///      Result: Alice atomically moved from Senior → Equity
